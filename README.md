# expenditure-calculator
Project made for my girlfriend to help her calculate our expenses when we lived together and we don't had a job yet.
Application is not responsive because it was designed for only her and mine computer.

Used: Vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS

Tutorial:

    Imie: Choose a person who made a shopping
    Opis: Review what item you want to add
    Kwota: Cost of this item
    Dla Kogo: 
        Wsp√≥lne - this item is usualy use by me and my girlfriend so cost will be divided by 2.
        Prywatne - this item was buy by person selected in "Imie" for another person, so cost of this should be given back.
